Day 1: Exploring and Understanding data

Measuring spread â€“ variance and standard deviation

Distributions allow us to characterize a large number of values using a smaller number of parameters. The normal distribution, which describes many types of real-world data, can be defined with just two: center and spread. The center of normal distribution is defined by its mean value, which we have used earlier. The spread is measured by a statistic called the standard deviation.In order to calculate the standard deviation, we must first obtain the variance, which is defined as the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean value. In mathematical notation, the variance of a set of n values of x is defined by the following formula. The Greek letter mu (similar in appearance to an m or u) denotes the mean of the values, and the variance itself is denoted by the Greek letter sigma squared (similar to a b turned sideways):
